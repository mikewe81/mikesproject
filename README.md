Mikesproject

This is my first website project. I took the website of the company I work for and remade it to be more responsive. I
am beginning with the mobile version then expanding it out from there. I still have alot to learn just to have all the
basics down so I am trying to apply what I learn as I learn it. Any help would be appreciated. Looking for better
styling in CSS and also looking at ways to clean up code, maybe with some divs ids or classes. Final site will be 3
pages. I only have 2 so far but, the contact page will be up shortly.
